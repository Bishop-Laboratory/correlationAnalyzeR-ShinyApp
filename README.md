A web application interface for the correlationAnalyzeR R package written in Shiny.

## Local installation instructions

To set up a local shiny server running correlationAnalyzeR-ShinyApp, download and run the setUpServer.sh script (scripts/setUpServer.sh).
This script should automatically install all necessary dependencies (it was tested using a ubuntu AWS EC2 instance). To complete configuration of the shiny server, follow the instructions in the setUpServer.sh script comments about how to edit the configuration file.


`sudo bash correlationAnalyzeR-ShinyApp/setUpServer.sh`
